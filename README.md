# Tech-Blog

## Description

For this project I created a tech blog where users can visit to read and write about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. In my web application users will be able to login with a username and password and sign up if they are new to the website. The blog post will include a title, date created, content, and creator's name. In my web application the user will be able to create, edit and delete posts. The user will also be able to logout of thier profile when they are done with the application.
